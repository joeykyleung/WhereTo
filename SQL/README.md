As of now:
- Verify the scripts have been run manually before running one of the existing scripts.
- When new queries are run manually, add them as DML/DDL.
- When new DB loading scripts are made, just manually run and put them in this folder
    for safekeeping.

Possible improvements:
- A git based service(liquibase?) for managing DB updates.
